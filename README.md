## Project Description
The aims of this project is to develop a game in Python copying the famous game called even or odd which the user will be challenged by the computer to perform one or more matches if desired.

## The Steps
This game was developed in Python language, using the variable concepts, function definitions, conditionals (if, elif, else), data processing etc.

The user must choose a number from 0 to 10 and to pick even or odd. The computer chooses a number from 0 to 10 randomly and picks the opposite option chosen by the user. The computer sums up the numbers, presents the result and shows the classification of the number, if it is even or odd.

If the user wins, the computer will congratulate him/her. If the user loses, the computer will send a motivational message suggesting the user to try again. In both situations, the computer will also ask if the user would like to play again and thank for the participation.
